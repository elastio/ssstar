    # Unfortunately `cargo-release` seems to not be smart enough to look at `dev-dependencies` when deciding
    # in what order to publish crates, so we can't let it perform the actual publishing.  Need to do that manually.
    #
    # However the tag that this build runs on was produced by `cargo release`, so all of the versions are set correctly
    # and everything is in place to proceed with publishing
